# Extended-Eucldiean-and-Square-and-Multiply-algorithms
In arithmetic and computer programming, the extended Euclidean algorithm is an extension to the Euclidean algorithm, and computes, in addition to the greatest common divisor (gcd) of integers a and b, also the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity, which are integers x and y such that  ax+by=gcd(a,b). 

Square and multiply is a general method for fast computation of large positive integer powers of a number, or more generally of an element of a semigroup, like a polynomial or a square matrix.
